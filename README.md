1. Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive guide to developing a Coupon Management System using Spring Boot. The system manages users, coupons, products, and purchase redemptions, following best practices and clean code principles.

Git Repository: Employee Assessment Riwi
2. Technical Requirements

    Use a relational database.
    Expose REST endpoints for all operations.
    Use Spring Boot for the application framework.
    Implement error handling and input data validation.
    Utilize a version control system (GIT) with Git Flow.
    Fully document the API with Swagger in English.
    Deploy the API on a PaaS service (e.g., Render, Railway, Heroku).
    Apply clean code principles (SOLID, Design Patterns).
    Use a task manager like Jira to track responsibilities and tasks within the team.

3. Project Setup
Initial Setup

    Create a Spring Boot project:
        Use Spring Initializr to generate the project.
        Add necessary dependencies such as Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, MySQL Driver, Lombok, and Spring Boot DevTools.

    Set up the relational database:
        Use PostgreSQL as the database.
        Create a database schema named coupon_management.
        Configure the application to connect to the database.

Entities and Relationships

    Create entity classes:
        User
        Coupon
        Product
        Purchase
        RedemptionHistory

    Define relationships:
        One-to-Many and Many-to-One relationships as per the relational model.

Repository and Service Layer

    Create repositories for each entity:
        Define interfaces for User, Coupon, Product, Purchase, and RedemptionHistory.

    Create service classes:
        Implement CRUD operations and business logic.

REST Controllers

    Create REST controllers:
        Expose endpoints for users, coupons, products, and purchase redemptions.

4. Team Responsibilities
Team Leader

    Name: Juan Pablo Regino Penagos
    Role: Oversee the project, ensure timely delivery, manage task distribution.
    Strengths: Leadership and organization.
    Weaknesses: Time management under high pressure.
    Leadership Style: Servant leadership, ensuring team members have what they need to succeed.

Team Members

    Name: Ken Castro
        Role: Backend Developer
        Strengths: Database management.
        Weaknesses: Testing, quality assurance.

5. Task Management

We utilized Trello for task management. Each task was clearly defined with specific responsibilities assigned to each team member.
Example Task

    Task: 001 - Creation Entities
    Assigned To: Carolina Garcia
    Description: Creation of entities for the project (User, Coupon, Product, Purchase, RedemptionHistory)
    Status: In Progress

6. API Documentation

    Tool: Swagger
    Language: English
    Endpoints: Documented endpoints include user registration, coupon creation, product listing, purchase creation, and coupon redemption.

7. Deployment

    Service: Render
    Deployment Steps:
        Create an account on the chosen PaaS.
        Connect the project repository.
        Set up environment variables and database connections.
        Deploy the application.

8. Code Quality and Best Practices

    Followed SOLID principles.
    Applied design patterns where appropriate.
    Ensured clean, readable, and maintainable code.

9. Error Handling and Data Validation

    Implemented global exception handling.
    Validated input data at the controller level to ensure data integrity and security.

10. Conclusion

Our team demonstrated effective collaboration and communication throughout the project. Under the guidance of the team leader, we divided responsibilities based on individual strengths and areas of expertise, ensuring that each task was completed efficiently and to a high standard. The team leaderâ€™s servant leadership style fostered an environment of support and empowerment, allowing team members to take ownership of their tasks while knowing they had the necessary resources and support to succeed.

Our use of Trello for task management was instrumental in keeping the project on track. Each task was clearly defined, assigned, and monitored, allowing us to track progress and make adjustments as necessary. This approach ensured that responsibilities were clear, deadlines were met, and the workload was distributed evenly among team members.

The adoption of Git Flow in our version control practices allowed for a smooth and organized development process. Descriptive commit messages and coherent branching strategies made the codebase easy to navigate and understand, facilitating collaboration and reducing the risk of conflicts.

Overall, this project showcased our commitment to high-quality software development through effective leadership, strategic task management, and rigorous adherence to best practices. The result is a robust and maintainable Coupon Management System that meets the needs of its users and stakeholders. The success of this project is a testament to the power of teamwork and the value of combining diverse skills and expertise towards a common goal.
